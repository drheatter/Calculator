# Calculator

This is an implementation of a basic calculator on an HTML page using JavaScript. It was made as part of the Web Development 101 curriculum at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator). It supports the four basic arithmetic functions and correctly handles the order-of-operations if multiple operations are entered consecutively. Input can be done using buttons or the user's keyboard.
